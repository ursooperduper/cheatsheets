## Why are you doing this?

I love keyboard shortcuts. I wanted an easy to reference collection of keyboard shortcuts for my favorite tools and an simple way to share them with others.

## Can I contribute?

Yes please! Let's grow this collection! There are three ways to contribute:

1. Open a Issue with a requested app/tool that you'd like to see added. As I have time, I'll add that tool to the ever-growing collection.

2. Fork master and add a cheatsheet file in YAML format. There are two files to commit. The first is a YAML file containing all the shortcuts which lives in the ```_data``` directory. The second is a Markdown file that consists of a Front Matter entry with details on how the digital and print cheatsheet should be organized. This file lives in the ```_cheatsheets``` directory.

3. Find missing keyboard shortcuts or errors in the existing doc and submit a PR with a fix.
